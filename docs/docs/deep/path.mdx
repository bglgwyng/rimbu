## Overview

`Path` is a function to easily retrieve and update a possibly nested property in an (immutable) object in TypeScript.
As shown in the `Patch` documentation, it can be quite hard to update an immutable object without helpers.
That `Path` object allows you to specify the location of a nested property using a string:

```ts
import { Deep } from '@rimbu/core';

const person = {
  name: 'Bart',
  address: {
    street: 'Evergreen Terrace',
    number: 742,
  },
};

// set the address number to 760
const updatedPerson1 = Deep.patchAt(person, 'address.number', 760);

// get the person street
// usually not very useful, but has its use cases
const street = Deep.getAt(person, 'address.street');
```

### Example sandbox

The following CodeSandbox shows more examples of how to use the `Path` object:

<SandBox path="deep/path.ts" />

## Details of the `Path` types.

Paths into values can be of two types: **read-only** or **writeable**. Read-only paths are
used in methods like `Deep.getAt` to retrieve values in objects. In this case, optional
chaining is allowed, so that undefined is returned if any value in the path is null or undefined.

Writeable paths are used in methods like `Deep.patchAt`. Here the value needs to be read, but also updated
back into the result object. Having optional chaining would complicate the behavior of such methods. For
this reason, optional chaining is not allowed for these methods.

The `Path.Result` type determines the result of applying a specific string path to a given value.

Paths have a similar format to normal TypeScript chaining:

```ts
const v = {
  a: [1, 2],
  b: {
    c: { d: true } as { d: boolean } | null,
  },
};

// equivalent
const r1 = v.a[0];
const r2 = Deep.getAt(v, 'a[0]');

// equivalent
const r3 = v.b.c?.d;
const r4 = Deep.getAt(v, 'b.c?.d');
```

### Read-only paths, `Path.Get<T>`

The `Path.Get` type represents a read-only path supporting optional chaining.

This includes:

- simple property access, e.g. for `{ a: { b: 2 } }` -> `"a.b"`
- simple array access, e.g. for `{ a: [1, 2] }` -> `"a[0]"`
- simple tuple access, e.g. for `{ a: [1, { b: 3 }] as [number, { b: number }] }` -> `"a[1].b"`
- optional array nested content access, e.g. for `{ a: [{ b: 1 }] as { b: number}[] }` -> `"a[0]?.b"`
- optional property chaining, e.g. for `{ a: null as { b: number} | null }` -> `"a?.b"`

### Writeable patths, `Path.Set<T>`

The `Path.Set` type represents a writeable path into values, which are
more limited than read-only paths.

Writeable paths support:

- simple property access, e.g. for `{ a: { b: 2 } }` -> `"a.b"`
- simple array access, e.g. for `{ a: [1, 2] }` -> `"a[0]"`
- simple tuple access, e.g. for `{ a: [1, { b: 3 }] as [number, { b: number }] }` -> `"a[1].b"`
