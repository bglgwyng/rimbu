# Immutable collections and tools for TypeScript

Rimbu consists of TypeScript projects focused on immutability. This is the monorepo for all Rimbu projects.

For complete documentation please visit the _[Rimbu Docs](http://rimbu.org)_.

The main projects are:

| Name                               | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [@rimbu/core](packages/core)       | Immutable collections including `List`, `SortedMap`, `EdgeGraph`, `HashBiMultiMap` and many more.                                           |
| [@rimbu/deep](packages/deep)       | Utilities to define immutable views on plain JS objects, and to easily handle and manipulate (e.g. create changed copies) of those objects. |
| [@rimbu/actor](packages/actor)     | A framework-agnostic synchronous state management library that uses immutable objects under the hood.                                       |
| [@rimbu/reactor](packages/reactor) | A framework that allows usage of `@rimbu/actor` objects in `React`.                                                                         |
