# @rimbu/deep

Offers tools to use handle plain JS objects as immutable objects. The [`Patch` object](https://rimbu.org/docs/deep/patch) allows convenient immutable modification of simple objects. The [`Match` object](https://rimbu.org/docs/deep/match) allows easy matching on plain objects. The [`Path` object](https://rimbu.org/docs/deep/path) allows easy querying of nested values. The [`Immutable` type](https://rimbu.org/docs/deep/immutable) makes it easy to create plain objects that that have compile-time protection against mutation. The [`Tuple` type](https://rimbu.org/docs/deep/tuple) is a utility to have similar functionality as `as const` but less strict.

For complete documentation please visit the [Immutable Objects overview](https://rimbu.org/docs/deep/overview) in the _[Rimbu Docs](https://rimbu.org)_.

Or [Try Out Rimbu](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vitoke/rimbu-sandbox/tree/main?previewwindow=console&view=split&editorsize=65&moduleview=1&module=/src/index.ts) in CodeSandBox.

## Installation

All types are exported through `@rimbu/core`. It is recommended to use that package.

To install this package only:

### Yarn/NPM

> `yarn add @rimbu/deep`

or

> `npm i @rimbu/deep`

### Deno

Create a file called `rimbu.ts` and add the following:

> ```ts
> export * from 'https://deno.land/x/rimbu/deep/mod.ts';
> ```

Or using a pinned version (`x.y.z`):

> ```ts
> export * from 'https://deno.land/x/rimbu/deep@x.y.z/mod.ts';
> ```

Then import what you need from `rimbu.ts`:

```ts
import { patch } from './rimbu.ts';
```

Because Rimbu uses complex types, it's recommended to use the `--no-check` flag (your editor should already have checked your code) and to specify a `tsconfig.json` file with the settings described below.

Running your script then becomes:

> `deno run --no-check --config tsconfig.json <your-script>.ts`

## Recommended `tsconfig.json` settings

Rimbu uses advanced and recursive typing, potentially making the TS compiler quite slow. It is recommended to set the following values in the `tsconfig.json` file of your project:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noStrictGenericChecks": true
  }
}
```

## Usage

```ts
import { patch } from '@rimbu/deep';

console.log(
  patch({
    a: 'a',
    b: { c: 1, d: true },
  })({
    a: 'q',
    b: { c: (v) => v + 1 },
  })
);
// => { a: 'q', b: { c: 2, d: true }}
```
