# @rimbu/graph

This package exports the following main types:

| Name                       | Description                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ArrowGraph<N>`            | a generic directed graph with nodes of type N                                 |
| `ArrowGraphHashed<N>`      | a directed graph with hashed nodes of type N                                  |
| `ArrowGraphSorted<N>`      | a directed graph with sorted nodes of type N                                  |
| `EdgeGraph<N>`             | a generic undirected graph with nodes of type N                               |
| `EdgeGraphHashed<N>`       | an undirected graph with hashed nodes of type N                               |
| `EdgeGraphSorted<N>`       | an undirected graph with sorted nodes of type N                               |
| `Graph<N>`                 | a generic graph with nodes of type N                                          |
| `ValuedGraph<N, V>`        | a generic graph with nodes of type N and edges with value type V              |
| `VariantGraph<N>`          | a generic type-variant graph with nodes of type N                             |
| `VariantValuedGraph<N, V>` | a generic type-variant graph with nodes of type N and edges with value type V |

## Installation

All types are exported through [`@rimbu/core`](../core). It is recommended to use this package.

To install separately:

> `yarn add @rimbu/graph`

or

> `npm i @rimbu/graph`

### recommended tsconfig settings

Rimbu uses advanced and recursive typing, potentially making the TypeScript compiler quite slow in some cases, or causing infinite recursion. It is recommended to set the following values in the `tsconfig.json` file of your project:

```json
{
  //  ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noStrictGenericChecks": true
  }
}
```

## Usage

```ts
import { EdgeGraphSorted } from '@rimbu/graph';

console.log(EdgeGraphSorted.of([1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1], [5]).toString());
```
