To install separately:

`yarn add @rimbu/common`

or

`npm i @rimbu/common`

## Usage

```ts
import { Eq } from '@rimbu/core';

console.log(Eq.stringCaseInsentitive()('abc', 'AbC'));
// => true
```

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CollectFun`    | types and values used in various `collect` methods in the collection.                                    |
| `Comp`          | an interface and default implementations of comparison functions to order/sort values.                   |
| `Eq`            | an interface and default implementations of equality functions to check value equality                   |
| `Err`           | functions to easily create error throwing behavior as fallback values                                    |
| `FastIterable`  | an `Iterable` implementation that can be more performant than usual iterables                            |
| `IndexRange`    | utilities to select index ranges in indexed collections                                                  |
| `OptLazy`       | a utility to provide values that can optionally be lazy                                                  |
| `Range`         | utility types to specify ranges for comparable types                                                     |
| `Reducer`       | an API to create reusable pieces of logic that process streams of data that can be processed in parallel |
| `TraverseState` | a utility for loops to maintain the traversal state                                                      |
| `Update`        | a standard way to update a value                                                                         |

Other than these values, there are a number of utility types that are exported that are also used throughout the collection.
