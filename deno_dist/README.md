# Immutable collections and tools for TypeScript

Rimbu is a TypeScript library focused on _immutable, performant, and type-safe collections_ and other tools. Its main aim is to allow programmers to create safe and performant programs without getting in the way. It is inspired by various other collection libraries, mainly Java's Guava library, the Java 8 Collection library, and Scala's collection library plus various ideas from the Scala community.

## Quick overview of features and benefits

- Extensive set of collection types to cover many problems that would otherwise require more coding to solve.
- Strongly typed API: compiler wil prevent common errors and guide you towards safe code.
- No external dependencies.
- Available for Web, Node.js and Deno.
- Provides sane defaults but allows extensive customization and configuration.

For complete documentation please visit the _[Rimbu Docs](https://rimbu.org)_ or the _[Rimbu API Docs](https://rimbu.org/api)_.
