# @rimbu/core

This package exports all the Rimbu collections, plus the contents of the `@rimbu/common` package. Its aim is to provide an easy to use access point for the collections.

For complete documentation please visit the _[Rimbu Docs](http://rimbu.org)_.

Or [Try Me Out](https://codesandbox.io/s/rimbu-sandbox-d4tbk?previewwindow=console&view=split&editorsize=65&moduleview=1&module=/src/index.ts) in CodeSandBox.

## Installation

To get started with the immutable collections, which are exported through `@rimbu/core`, you can use the following.

### Yarn/NPM

For yarn:

> `yarn add @rimbu/core`

For npm:

> `npm i @rimbu/core`

### Deno

Create a file called `rimbu.ts` and add the following:

> ```ts
> export * from 'https://deno.land/x/rimbu/core/mod.ts';
> ```

Or using a pinned version (`x.y.z`):

> ```ts
> export * from 'https://deno.land/x/rimbu/core@x.y.z./mod.ts';
> ```

Then import what you need from `rimbu.ts`:

```ts
import { HashMap } from './rimbu.ts';
```

Because Rimbu uses complex types, it's recommended to use the `--no-check` flag (your editor should already have checked your code) and to specify a `tsconfig.json` file with the settings described below.

Running your script then becomes:

> `deno run --no-check --config tsconfig.json <your-script>.ts`

## Recommended `tsconfig.json` settings

Rimbu uses advanced and recursive typing, potentially making the TypeScript compiler quite slow in some cases, or causing infinite recursion. It is recommended to set the following values in the `tsconfig.json` file of your project:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noStrictGenericChecks": true
  }
}
```

## Usage

Using direct imports:

```ts
import { List, Stream, SortedMap } from '@rimbu/core';

const list = List.of(1, 3, 2, 4, 2);

const stream = Stream.from(list).map((v) => [v, String(v * 2)]);

const map = SortedMap.from(stream);

console.log(map.toArray());
// => [[1, '2'], [2, '4'], [3, '6'], [4, '8']]
```

The same code using the `Create` menu-object:

```ts
import Rimbu from '@rimbu/core';

const list = Rimbu.Create.List.of(1, 3, 2, 4, 2);

const stream = Rimbu.Create.Stream.from(list).map((v) => [v, String(v * 2)]);

const map = Rimbu.Create.Map.Sorted.from(stream);

console.log(map.toArray());
// => [[1, '2'], [2, '4'], [3, '6'], [4, '8']]
```
