# @rimbu/core

This package exports all the Rimbu collections, plus the contents of the `@rimbu/common` package. Its aim is to provide an easy to use access point for the collections.

For complete documentation please visit the _[Rimbu Docs](https://rimbu.org)_.

Or [Try Out Rimbu](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vitoke/rimbu-sandbox/tree/main?previewwindow=console&view=split&editorsize=65&moduleview=1&module=/src/index.ts) in CodeSandBox.

## Installation

To get started with the immutable collections, which are exported through `@rimbu/core`, you can use the following.

### Yarn/NPM

For yarn:

> `yarn add @rimbu/core`

For npm:

> `npm i @rimbu/core`

### Deno

Create a file called `rimbu.ts` and add the following:

> ```ts
> export * from 'https://deno.land/x/rimbu/core/mod.ts';
> ```

Or using a pinned version (`x.y.z`):

> ```ts
> export * from 'https://deno.land/x/rimbu/core@x.y.z/mod.ts';
> ```

Then import what you need from `rimbu.ts`:

```ts
import { HashMap } from './rimbu.ts';
```

Because Rimbu uses complex types, it's recommended to use the `--no-check` flag (your editor should already have checked your code) and to specify a `tsconfig.json` file with the settings described below.

Running your script then becomes:

> `deno run --no-check --config tsconfig.json <your-script>.ts`

## Usage

Using direct imports:

```ts
import { List, Stream, SortedMap } from '@rimbu/core';

const list = List.of(1, 3, 2, 4, 2);

const stream = Stream.from(list).map((v) => [v, String(v * 2)]);

const map = SortedMap.from(stream);

console.log(map.toArray());
// => [[1, '2'], [2, '4'], [3, '6'], [4, '8']]
```

The same code using the `Create` menu-object:

```ts
import Rimbu from '@rimbu/core';

const list = Rimbu.Create.List.of(1, 3, 2, 4, 2);

const stream = Rimbu.Create.Stream.from(list).map((v) => [v, String(v * 2)]);

const map = Rimbu.Create.Map.Sorted.from(stream);

console.log(map.toArray());
// => [[1, '2'], [2, '4'], [3, '6'], [4, '8']]
```
