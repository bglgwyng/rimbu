# Contributing to Rimbu

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

Be sure to read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Our Development Process

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

As development process we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests.

Pull requests are the only way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests.

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Before submitting an issue, please search the existing issues to see if the issue has already been reported.

Please don't use the issues board to ask questions, for this you can use the TODO:Gitter channel.

Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

## Coding Style

The project is pre-configured with `prettier` and `eslint` configurations, please make sure your code adheres to this configuration by running:

- `yarn lint`
- `yarn format`

## License

By contributing to Rimbu, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT license.
